         Greetings, I am Jacob Perry. I am from the beautiful pacific northwest and hoping to improve on my programming
         skills. I am self taught in web, game and application programming but want to improve and certify my knowledge
         to make job searching easier. I also like to study other things in my free time. I have been working on
         learning Japanese on my own with slow but steady progress. はじめました、ぺりー•ジャコブです。プログラミングを勉強しています。

      <p>Washington state sits in the northwest corner of the United states on the Pacific ocean. It is know for its
         rainy weather, tech companies like Microsoft and Amazon, and also brands like Starbucks and Costco. Washington
         is split in half by the cascade mountains leaving the east side of the state warmer and dryer then the west.
         Washington has a lot of natural beauty and is a great place to spend time outdoors in the warm summer months
         going on hikes or jumping into the frigid puget sound.</p>
